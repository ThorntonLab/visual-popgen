  abstract = "A variety of results for genealogical and line-of-descent
              processes that arise in connection with the theory of some
              classical selectively neutral population genetics models are
              reviewed. While some new results and derivations are included,
              the principle aim is to demonstrate the central importance and
              simplicity of genealogical Markov chains in this theory.
              Considerable attention is given to ``diffusion time scale''
              approximations of such genealogical processes. A wide variety of
              results pertinent to (diffusion approximations of) the classical
              multiallele single-locus Wright-Fisher model and its relatives
              are simplified and unified by this approach. Other examples where
              such genealogical processes play an explicit role, such as the
              infinite sites and infinite alleles models, are discussed.",

@ARTICLE{Ralph2020-cg,
  title     = "Efficiently Summarizing Relationships in Large Samples: A
               General Duality Between Statistics of Genealogies and Genomes",
  author    = "Ralph, Peter and Thornton, Kevin and Kelleher, Jerome",
  abstract  = "As a genetic mutation is passed down across generations, it
               distinguishes those genomes that have inherited it from those
               that have not, providing a glimpse of the genealogical tree
               relating the genomes to each other at that site. Statistical
               summaries of genetic variation therefore also describe the
               underlying genealogies. We use this correspondence to define a
               general framework that efficiently computes single-site
               population genetic statistics using the succinct tree sequence
               encoding of genealogies and genome sequence. The general
               approach accumulates sample weights within the genealogical tree
               at each position on the genome, which are then combined using a
               summary function; different statistics result from different
               choices of weight and function. Results can be reported in three
               ways: by site, which corresponds to statistics calculated as
               usual from genome sequence; by branch, which gives the expected
               value of the dual site statistic under the infinite sites model
               of mutation, and by node, which summarizes the contribution of
               each ancestor to these statistics. We use the framework to
               implement many currently defined statistics of genome sequence
               (making the statistics' relationship to the underlying
               genealogical trees concrete and explicit), as well as the
               corresponding branch statistics of tree shape. We evaluate
               computational performance using simulated data, and show that
               calculating statistics from tree sequences using this general
               framework is several orders of magnitude more efficient than
               optimized matrix-based methods in terms of both run time and
               memory requirements. We also explore how well the duality
               between site and branch statistics holds in practice on trees
               inferred from the 1000 Genomes Project data set, and discuss
               ways in which deviations may encode interesting biological
               signals.",

               Beyond the Diffusion Approximation",
  author    = "Jouganous, Julien and Long, Will and Ragsdale, Aaron P and
               Gravel, Simon",
  abstract  = "Understanding variation in allele frequencies across populations
               is a central goal of population genetics. Classical models for
               the distribution of allele frequencies, using forward
               simulation, coalescent theory, or the diffusion approximation,
               have been applied extensively for demographic inference, medical
               study design, and evolutionary studies. Here we propose a
               tractable model of ordinary differential equations for the
               evolution of allele frequencies that is closely related to the
               diffusion approximation but avoids many of its limitations and
               approximations. We show that the approach is typically faster,
               more numerically stable, and more easily generalizable than the
               state-of-the-art software implementation of the diffusion
               approximation. We present a number of applications to human
               sequence data, including demographic inference with a
               five-population joint frequency spectrum and a discussion of the
               robustness of the out-of-Africa model inference to the choice of

  author   = "Kim, Yuseob and Stephan, Wolfgang",
  abstract = "The theory of genetic hitchhiking predicts that the level of
              genetic variation is greatly reduced at the site of strong
              directional selection and increases as the recombinational
              distance from the site of selection increases. This
              characteristic pattern can be used to detect recent directional
              selection on the basis of DNA polymorphism data. However, the
              large variance of nucleotide diversity in samples of moderate
              size imposes difficulties in detecting such patterns. We
              investigated the patterns of genetic variation along a
              recombining chromosome by constructing ancestral recombination
              graphs that are modified to incorporate the effect of genetic
              hitchhiking. A statistical method is proposed to test the
              significance of a local reduction of variation and a skew of the
              frequency spectrum caused by a hitchhiking event. This method
              also allows us to estimate the strength and the location of
              directional selection from DNA sequence data.",
