# Interactive Python notebooks

Some of the pages of this book use interactions requiring Python.
They are labelled in the table of contents with `(interactive Python)`.
These pages may show a graphic, but it *does not* work as intended until you launch the page in interactive mode.

To launch an interactive page, look for a "rocket ship" icon near the top right of the page.
Click the rocket ship, then click on `Binder`.
After some time (patience, please), you will get an interactive [jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebook.
Once the notebook is shown, select the `Cell` menu and then `Run all` to build the application.
