              Drosophila melanogaster",
  author   = "Kreitman, M",
  abstract = "The sequencing of eleven cloned Drosophila melanogaster alcohol
              dehydrogenase (Adh) genes from five natural populations has
              revealed a large number of previously hidden polymorphisms. Only
              one of the 43 polymorphisms results in an amino acid change, the
              one responsible for the two electrophoretic variants (fast,
              Adh-f, and slow, Adh-s) found in nearly all natural populations.
              The implication is that most amino acid changes in Adh would be
              selectively deleterious.",

@ARTICLE{Kim2002-to,
  title    = "Detecting a local signature of genetic hitchhiking along a
              recombining chromosome",
  author   = "Kim, Yuseob and Stephan, Wolfgang",
  abstract = "The theory of genetic hitchhiking predicts that the level of
              genetic variation is greatly reduced at the site of strong
              directional selection and increases as the recombinational
              distance from the site of selection increases. This
              characteristic pattern can be used to detect recent directional
              selection on the basis of DNA polymorphism data. However, the
              large variance of nucleotide diversity in samples of moderate
              size imposes difficulties in detecting such patterns. We
              investigated the patterns of genetic variation along a
              recombining chromosome by constructing ancestral recombination
              graphs that are modified to incorporate the effect of genetic
              hitchhiking. A statistical method is proposed to test the
              significance of a local reduction of variation and a skew of the
              frequency spectrum caused by a hitchhiking event. This method
              also allows us to estimate the strength and the location of
              directional selection from DNA sequence data.",
