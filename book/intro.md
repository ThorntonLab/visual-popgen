# Introduction

This book is a collection of visualisations developed for teaching population genetics.
The goal is to create a collection of interactive content that can be remixed alongside existing course material.

The icons near the top right of this page will take you to the `GitHub` repository for this book.

## Technologies used

* [Jupyter book](https://www.jupyterbook.org)
* [Observable](https://www.observablehq.com) notebooks.
  These are pure JavaScript inserted into the book via [embedding](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/introduction-to-embedding).
* [Holoviews](https://www.holoviews.org) creates interactive JavaScript applications that require Python.
  These pages require [MyBinder](https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/) to function, which just takes a few mouse clicks!.
  See {ref}`here <interactive_python_notebooks>` for details.

## Integrating the information into existing courses.

* Direct links to the many of the pages "just work" in "learning management" systems such as [Canvas](https://www.instructure.com/canvas).
  The exception is the pages requiring `MyBinder`.
  These pages need to be launched in the binder, or...
* ...you can use them in slides as described {ref}`here <interactive_python_in_slides>`.
* The Observable content can also be used in slides.
  See {ref}`here <observable_in_slides>` for instructions for `Jupyter` .
