              Drosophila melanogaster",

  abstract = "The sequencing of eleven cloned Drosophila melanogaster alcohol
              dehydrogenase (Adh) genes from five natural populations has
              revealed a large number of previously hidden polymorphisms. Only
              one of the 43 polymorphisms results in an amino acid change, the
              one responsible for the two electrophoretic variants (fast,
              Adh-f, and slow, Adh-s) found in nearly all natural populations.
              The implication is that most amino acid changes in Adh would be
              selectively deleterious.",
